🖼️ OpenCV Tutorial – Introduction to Computer Vision

Welcome to my OpenCV learning repository!
This tutorial series documents my step-by-step journey into Computer Vision using OpenCV (Python). The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in image processing, understand important CV concepts, and implement them using simple, well-explained code examples.

🚀 What You Will Learn

This tutorial covers the most essential topics in OpenCV, including:

✅ 1. Loading & Displaying Images / Videos

Reading images using cv2.imread()

Showing images with cv2.imshow()

Capturing video from webcam

✅ 2. Image Processing Basics

Converting images to grayscale

Blurring & smoothing techniques

Edge detection (Canny)

Thresholding

Morphological operations (dilate, erode)

✅ 3. Drawing & Annotation

Drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles)

Adding text on images

✅ 4. Geometric Transformations

Image resizing

Cropping

Rotation & translation

Perspective transforms

✅ 5. Contours & Shape Detection

Finding contours

Detecting shapes (triangle, square, circle)

Object boundary extraction

✅ 6. Face Detection

Using Haar Cascades to detect faces in real time

✅ 7. Advanced Concepts (Upcoming)

Color detection

Object tracking

Feature detection (SIFT/SURF)

Building small CV projects
